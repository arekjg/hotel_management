# Hotel Management console app

This is a simple console app I wrote while learning C++.  

Application lets the user to choose from a few given options to purchase goods and rent room/rooms. At the end it sums up all costs and prompts the total price to the user.  

Made in accordance with [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2xt5KIEHvc). Later I made some changes, so the app could be more universal:
- replaced all variables with arrays
- used for loops to store data in variables
- used for loops to prompt text in terminal instead of writing everything in code
- added sum function which calculates final price of purchased goods
- made the app universal, so it's possible to change freely number of items and their names without changing anything in later code
